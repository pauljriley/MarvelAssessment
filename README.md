# Description

You should create a simple Android app that provides easy access to a list of available comics hosted by Marvel and detailed information about each one of them.

## The app should:

* Display a list of the first 100 comics from the Marvel API. For each comic at least the thumbnail and title should be displayed
* When clicking on one of the comics, detailed information about it should be displayed including title, description, page count, price and authors of the comic
* Given a budget, the app should be able to find and list the maximum number of comics that you can buy without exceeding that budget from the 100 comics listed previously. Also all the comics combined should give you the maximum number of pages you can read
* The app is not expected to work offline but doing so would be a plus
* It’s recommended to include some unit tests for the most important classes

You can find the Marvel API documentation in the following link:

http://developer.marvel.com/docs

You can use the following keys to authenticate your app to use the API or you can create your own account. In any case don’t forget to include them in the project.

## Your public key

-> 54306733de0f5cd1418aa05a85fa062a <-

## Your private key

-> 5de1fabcda2ea08912bd8b09bca4321f50563655 <-

## Rules

The solution should be developed in Java using the Android framework.

You can use any 3rd party library but keep in mind that you should be able to justify why do you choose them and know how they work.

## Deliverables

Your code in a version-controlled repository e.g. git repository (ideally with multiple commits to demonstrate your workflow)

(Optional) Notes about how your solution could be improved, what would you do better, etc...
